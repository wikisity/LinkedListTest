# LinkedListTest

This project aims to implement a game called 'spy game' 

which is basically an application that can read a file 

and decrypt its hidden message. A file contains unknown  

number of messages and a message is made up of an integer and a string 

One goal is to figure out which message is 'fake' and which one is 'real'

Also I don't know how long a message will be, then I decided to use a 

LinkedList as data structure to save and process the message. I aim to display

a real clue/decrypt message and a real clue is simply a message(where the numbers 

made of perfect square and perfect cube have been sorted)
